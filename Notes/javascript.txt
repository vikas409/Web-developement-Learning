##Loop in js
  "In JavaScript, a loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
   It helps reduce repetitive code and automate tasks like iterating over arrays, counting numbers, or 
   processing user input."
     
     ##Types Of Loops
       JavaScript has 4 main types of loops.
        1.for loop – Most commonly used when we know how many times to run
         for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          console.log(i);
         }
          This loop is divided into 3 part 
          1.Initialization (let i = 0)

         2.Condition check (i < 5)

         3. Increment (i++)
         Har iteration ke baad condition check hoti hai, agar true hai to block run hota hai."
          
     2. While Loop :- This loop run till condition is true
           let i = 0;
           while (i < 5) {
           console.log(i);
           i++;
           }
        While Loop are use when we don't fix  iteration counts before execution
    
    3. do...while loop :- This loop at least once before checking the condition.
       let i = 0;
       do {
       console.log(i);
       i++;
       } while (i < 5);
    
    4. for...of Loop – (Arrays, Strings, Iterables ke liye)
       📌 Used to loop through:
       Arrays
       Strings
       Sets
      Maps
     Anything that is iterable

      let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
     for (let fruit of fruits) {
     console.log(fruit);
     }

     ✅ Example with String:

     for (let char of "Champ") {
     console.log(char);
     }

     ✅ Example with Set:

      let numSet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);

      for (let n of numSet) {
      console.log(n);
     }



     5️⃣ for...in – Objects ke keys loop karne ke liye
      
      Used to loop through:
      Objects → keys (properties)

      Arrays → indices (not recommended)   

     let user = { name: "Champians", age: 22 };
     for (let key in user) {
     console.log(key + ": " + user[key]);
     }

      Example with Array (Not Ideal):

      let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

      for (let index in fruits) {
      console.log(index, fruits[index]);
      }

      let arr = [10, 20, 30];
      arr.test = "hello";

     for (let i in arr) {
      console.log(i);  // 0, 1, 2, test ✅
     }

     for (let i of arr) {
     console.log(i);  // 10, 20, 30 ❌ (no "test")
     }
📌 Reason:

for...in also loops over custom properties (non-numeric)

for...of ignores them and focuses only on array values
